# Dataviz
Data Viz Midterm Project
For this project, I want you to visualize data from a dataset of your choice. The dataset has to be rich
enough so that you can create the following charts:
• A chart that shows the distribution of a single categorical variable
• A chart that shows the distribution of a single quantitative variable
• A chart that shows the distribution of two categorical variables
• A chart that shows the distribution of a quantitative variable across categories of a
categorical variable
• A chart that shows the relationship between two quantitative variables
